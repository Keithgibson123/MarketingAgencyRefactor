# MarketingAgencyRefactor
In this ticket i changed the soup of divs into more semantic language. The reason being so the code base is easier to navigate through and future coders who might look at this can be more aware of the things they are trying to locat. I also added a missing class and id to the application so that the error inside would be no longer.
